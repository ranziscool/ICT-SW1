            <p>The typical family consists of a married couple with 2.5 kids, a lovely home with a white picket fence, and a dog. The "typical" family image has, however, altered significantly over the past ten years, especially with the approval of homosexual marriage and the ease of obtaining green cards; this has had a significant impact not only on our society but also on social media. The humorous mockumentary Modern Family serves as an illustration of this altered media landscape. Three very archetypal families live their interrelated lives in this fictional comedy series with an interview format. The show focuses on these three families: a "average" American family with a man named Phil and a woman named Claire who are married and have three children; a gay couple with a child they adopted; and an older man named Jay who is the father of Claire and Mitchell and is married to a gorgeous young Columbian woman and has a son as well.</p>

        	<p>Julie Bowen portrays Claire Pritchett, who is Phil Dunphy's wife, the mother of the three Dunphy children, and the daughter of Jay, Mitchell's older sister. She is renowned for handling her children properly, frequently seeing through Haley's deceit and Luke's persistent lying. Though her family is the exact cause of her worry, weariness, and freak outs. She is always trying to deal with Haley's high hormones, Alex's "know-it-all" attitude, and Luke's true lack of common sense. </p>

        	<p class="text-dark" align="center">Phil Dunphy</p>
        	<p>As a dedicated husband and father who adores his wife, Claire, and makes an effort to connect with his three children on a regular basis, Phil defines himself as a "cool dad." He employs a parenting strategy he calls "peerenting," which combines speaking with peers while also acting like a parent. Phil is typically shown as a nice person who always chooses the right course of action when faced with challenges, with the exception of times when he is pushed to the brink, as in "Fulgencio," where he used mafia-like methods to address his family's issues. Phil frequently obsesses over becoming his kids' best friend, but as they approach puberty, this falls short.</p>

        	<p>Even though Alex is the second youngest of her family, she is likely the most intellectual and well-read, even surpassing Manny and her lawyer uncle Mitchell. Being an overachiever, she frequently speaks to people in a patronizing and sarcastic manner, even though most of the time no one understands her humor.</p>
